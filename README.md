## MongoDB DataTypes

* **String** â This is the most commonly used datatype to store the data. String in MongoDB must be UTF-8 valid.
* **Integer** â This type is used to store a numerical value. Integer can be 32 bit or 64 bit depending upon your server.
* **Boolean** â This type is used to store a boolean (true/ false) value.
* **Double** â This type is used to store floating point values.
* **Min/ Max keys** â This type is used to compare a value against the lowest and highest BSON elements.
* **Arrays** â This type is used to store arrays or list or multiple values into one key.
* **Timestamp** â ctimestamp. This can be handy for recording when a document has been modified or added.
* **Object** â This datatype is used for embedded documents.
* **Null** â This type is used to store a Null value.
* **Symbol** â This datatype is used identically to a string; however, it's generally reserved for languages that use a specific symbol type.
* **Date** â This datatype is used to store the current date or time in UNIX time format. You can specify your own date time by creating object of Date and passing day, month, year into it.
* **Object ID** â This datatype is used to store the document's ID.
* **Binary data** â This datatype is used to store binary data.
* **Code** â This datatype is used to store JavaScript code into the document.
* **Regular expression** â This datatype is used to store regular expression.

## Mongoose Schema Types

#### Mongoose's schema types provide an additional layer of validation and features on top of MongoDB's BSON types.When defining Mongoose schema types, you can set options for validation, default values, and more.

* **String:** Corresponds to the BSON string data type.
* **Number:** Represents a numeric value and corresponds to various BSON number data types (e.g., double, int).
* **Date:** Represents a date and time value, corresponding to the BSON date data type.
* **Boolean:** Represents a true or false value, corresponding to the BSON boolean data type.
* **Buffer:** Represents binary data (e.g., images, files) and corresponds to the BSON binary data type.
* **ObjectId:** Represents a MongoDB document's primary key (_id) and corresponds to the BSON ObjectId data type.
* **Array:** Represents an array of values of the same or mixed data types, corresponding to the BSON array data type.
* **Embedded Documents:** Represents an embedded document within another document, similar to subdocuments in MongoDB.
* **Mixed:** Represents a flexible or "schema-less" type that can hold data of any type.
* **Virtual:** Not a storage type, but used to define computed properties or virtual fields.

## Mongoose Schema Rules

1. **type:** Specifies the data type for the field. Common types include `String`, `Number`, `Date`, `Boolean`, `Buffer`, `ObjectId`, `Array`, and more.
2. **required:** Indicates that the field must have a value when saving the document.
3. **default:** Sets a default value for the field if no value is provided during document creation.
4. **enum:** Specifies an array of allowed values for the field.
5. **min and max:** Defines the minimum and maximum values for numeric fields (e.g., `Number`, `Date`).
6. **maxlength and minlength:** Defines the maximum and minimum lengths for string fields.
7. **match:** Applies a regular expression pattern that the field's value must match (e.g., for validating email addresses).
8. **unique:** Ensures that the field's value is unique across all documents in the collection.
9. **validate:** Allows you to define custom validation functions for the field. This function should return a Boolean indicating the validity of the value.
10. **index:** Creates an index on the field for faster querying. You can set this to `true` or an object with index options.
11. **sparse:** Makes the index sparse, meaning that documents without the field won't be included in the index.

13. **trim:** Removes whitespace from the beginning and end of string values.
14. **uppercase and lowercase:** Transforms string values to uppercase or lowercase.
15. **get and set:** Define custom getter and setter functions for the field, allowing you to transform the data during retrieval and storage.
16. **validate method:** You can define custom validation methods for your fields using the `validate` method. This method allows you to perform complex validation logic.
17. **timestamps:** Adds `createdAt` and `updatedAt` fields to the document, which are automatically populated with timestamps.
18. **transform:** Allows you to specify a function that will be applied to the document's data when converting it to a JSON object.
